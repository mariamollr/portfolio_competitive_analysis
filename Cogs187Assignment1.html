            again in order to get to the actual design portfolio. In the left corner there is a new menu, but this does not do anything here.
	    This gives the portfolio an unfinished feel. The navigation is also slightly inconsistent. The download page has a different type of
	    navigation than the other pages. In most pages you navigate by clicking on the small images mentioned under functionality, but in this
	    case you navigate through the images with back and forth buttons. Clicking on the main logo sends the user back to the index site.
