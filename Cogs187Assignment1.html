            I think the pink, purple and red color palette also makes the brand girlish and romantic. After playing around with
            the portfolio I will also characterize it as spontaneous, as the spots changes when moving the mouse over them.
            The name Biddlefufty has a friendly ring to it.</td>

            <th>Functionality</th>
            <td>The fixed menu makes the navigation functional. The user can choose to go to a different site within the portfolio at any time.
            The small icons that you can mouse-over to view, helps make the navigation efficient. This enables the user to see the different designs
            without cliking back and forth. This functionality also has the descriptive text: roll over icons to view, click to enlarge.
            The menu choises lights up when moused over but when it is clicked it goes back to its original color. If the selected link had stayed
            light up it would be easier for the user to keep track of where he/she is at all times.</td>

            image frames are filled with pictures. This keeps the portfolio interesting and makes me wanna explore it further.
            This is also what makes the site fun and playful. The only thing missing is a search field.</td>

            <th>Navigation</th>
            <td>The fixed menu is the main navigation element of the portfolio. It is however not clear how many sites the portfolio
            contains when the user is located on the index page. When cliking on design you first get a description and have to click
            again in order to get to the actual design portfolio. In the left corner there it is a new menu, but this does not work here,
            in other places it does. The navigation is also slightly inconsistent. The downloads page has a different type of navigation than
            the other pages. In most pages you navigate by cliking on the small images mentioned under functionality, but in this case you
            navigate through the images with back and forth buttons. Cliking on the main logo sends the user back to the index site.

	    opposed to pictures within the journal. In the journal you navigate by cliking on the arrows of eighter side of the picture.
